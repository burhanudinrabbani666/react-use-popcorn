# 🍿 Use Popcorn

This is a Udemy project from the React: []() course. **Use Popcorn** is a simple movie rating application. The topics covered in this repository cover intermediate material for React developers, such as prototypes and composition. This project was built using modern project standards, such as Bun and Vite, but does not yet use Typescript. This repository is for educational purposes only.

All material covered in the lesson is stored in a **notes** folder, which is continuously updated as I revisit this material and review the lessons.

Keep up the good work 🔥🔥🔥.
