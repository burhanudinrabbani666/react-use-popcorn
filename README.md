<h1 align="center">🍿 Use Popcorn </h1>

Use Popcorn is a project from the Udemy course **"The Ultimate React Course"**. It’s a movie search and rating app designed to practice **intermediate React concepts**, with a strong focus on component composition, hooks, and real-world state management patterns.

This repository is for educational purposes only. All learning materials and personal takeaways are stored in the `notes/` folder, which I continuously update while revisiting the course.

Keep up the good work 🔥🔥🔥
